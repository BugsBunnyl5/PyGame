pythonprogramming.net "A bit Racey" tutorial

The controls are really easy.
Just use your left/right arrows on your keyboard.
Do not hit the side or the boxes; that will kill your racecar.
"P" is used to pause the game. Don't use this just yet if you are really far into the game,
because there is no way yet to unpause the game.
Have fun and safe driving!
